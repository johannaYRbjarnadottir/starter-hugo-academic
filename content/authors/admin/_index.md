I joined the research training group “The Dynamics of Demography, Democratic Processes and Public Policy” (Dynamics), jointly organized by the Hertie School and the Department of Social Sciences at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, as a PhD candidate in September 2020. 

I attained my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Social Sciences at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. During my studies, I worked at the Berlin Social Science Center (WZB) in the department of democracy and democratization. 
My research interests involve political parties, democratic responsiveness and political participation. My key focus is the analysis of political parties’ responsiveness and the political consequences of protest mobilisation.
